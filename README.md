# Third-Party-Supervised-
This is the implementation of our work Third-Party Supervised Fine-tuning for Neural Word Alignments


 Previous work has demonstrated that fine-tuning pre-trained cross-lingual language models by self-training can achieve competitive word alignment results. In this work, we propose to use word alignments generated by a third-party word aligner to supervise the fine-tuning process.
